Docker compose
	Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container 
	Docker applications using a single YAML configuration file (docker-compose.yml). 
	It simplifies the process of managing and orchestrating multiple containers, 
	their networks, and volumes.

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose -v

-make a directory compose
-under that directory make a file name wpwala.yml

wpwala.yml

version: '3.9'
services:
  db:
    image: mysql
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"  # Map MySQL port for external access if needed
    volumes:
